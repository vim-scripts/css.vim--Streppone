This compiler script allows to validate CSS files within vim, through W3C's CSS validation web-service. The compiler file invokes a helper perl script that connects to jigsaw.w3.org and reports all css errors and warnings, showing them up directly in the vim buffer (with :copen command, BTW).

Surely the script can be made better in many ways.
Suggestions welcome!

REQUIREMENTS:
- a [dr]ecent perl interpreter installed
- WebService::Validator::CSS::W3C module installed from CPAN.
