* SUMMARY 

This compiler script allows to validate CSS files within vim,
through W3C's CSS validation web-service.

The compiler file invokes a helper perl script that connects to jigsaw.w3.org
and reports all css errors and warnings, showing them up directly in the vim
buffer (with :copen command, BTW), like gcc, or javac, ...

The script can be made better in many ways.
If you have suggestions, you are welcome.

* REQUIREMENTS

  - a recent perl interpreter installed
  - WebService::Validator::CSS::W3C module installed from CPAN.

* INSTALLATION

  Installation is done in two simple steps:

  1) Copy the css.vim compiler file to your vim's compiler
     folder (usually /usr/share/vim/vimxx/compiler)
   
  2) Copy the `validate_css' perl script to your favourite binary
     folder (usually /usr/local/bin will do). This folder should
     be in your $PATH.
    
  For the perl script to work, you should have WebService::Validator::W3C::CSS
  perl module installed.
  
  If you don't have this module installed, the script will prompt you
  and try to install it automatically from CPAN.
  If you don't succeed, try the following command on your shell:

    perl -MCPAN -e 'install WebService::Validator::W3C::CSS'

  If even this does not succeed, point your browser to:

  and follow the instructions.
